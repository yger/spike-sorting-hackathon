## Project Description

The goal of the project is to have a quick way to design/implement and benchmark new clustering solutions in order
to get a better understanding of the various pros and cons. During the Hackathon, we mostly try to start the implementation
of the clustering algorithm implemented in YASS, while simultaneously making a clustering benchmark in order to evaluate
the performance of the clustering algorithm.

## Objectives

An important step in the spike sorting is the clustering, whose goal is to put labels on detected peaks and so assign then to a unit.
The number of method proposed for thois is enormous, and every sorter has its own custom method. Having many methods implemented in the 
same place could lead to better benchmark, and/or at least to a better comparison of the various pros and cons. 

## Approach and Plan

Implement method from several tools. We started to benchmark various methods implemented either from tridesclous, spyking-circus or Yass. 
None of them is finished yet, but the whole machinery to port them and to benchmark them is up and running
